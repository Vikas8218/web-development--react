    <h1>My Exciting Journey to Haridwar</h1>
    <p>Last month, I had the incredible opportunity to visit Haridwar, a city full of rich culture, stunning landscapes, and delicious food. Here are some highlights from my journey.</p>

    <h2>Har Ki Pauri</h2>
    <p>My adventure began at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Har_Ki_Pauri" target="_blank">Har Ki Pauri</a>, the famous ghat on the banks of the Ganges River. The evening Ganga Aarti was a mesmerizing experience.</p>

    <h2>Mansa Devi Temple</h2>
    <p>Next, I visited the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansa_Devi_Temple,_Haridwar" target="_blank">Mansa Devi Temple</a>, which is perched atop the Bilwa Parvat on the Sivalik Hills. The cable car ride to the temple offered breathtaking views of the city.</p>

    <h2>Chandi Devi Temple</h2>
    <p>No trip to Haridwar is complete without visiting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandi_Devi_Temple,_Haridwar" target="_blank">Chandi Devi Temple</a>. The trek up Neel Parvat was challenging but rewarding.</p>
